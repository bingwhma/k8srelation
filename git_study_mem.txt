Devops学习总结

通过学习DevOps Fundamentals，
了解了Devop的Core Values: CAMS
为了Devop成功进行的10个实践
以及Devops常见的一些工具


5 Key DevOps Methodologies
1.	People over Process over Tools
2.	Continuous Delivery
3.	Lean Management
4.	Visible Ops style Change Control
5.	Infrastructure as Code


DevOps Building Block: Lean
7 Principles of Lean Software Development
• ELIMINATE WASTE
• AMPLIFY LEARNING
• DECIDE AS LATE AS POSSIBLE
• DELIVER AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
• EMPOWER THE TEAM
• BUILD INTEGRITY IN
• SEE THE WHOLE

The Seven Wastes (Muda) of Lean Software
Waste #1 - Partially Done Work
Waste #2 - Extra Features
Waste #3 - Relearning
Waste #4 - Handoffs
Waste #5 - Delays
Waste #6 - Task Switching
Waste #7 - Defects

Build-Measure-Learn
• BUILD – MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT
• MEASURE – THE OUTCOME AND INTERNAL METRICS
• LEARN – ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM AND YOUR SOLUTION
• REPEAT – GO DEEPER WHERE IT’S NEEDED

The Continuous Delivery Pipeline
To successfully perform Continuous Delivery:
1.	Only build artifacts once
2.	Artifacts should be immutable
3.	Deployment should go to a copy of production before going into production
4.	Stop deploys if it a previous step fails
5.	Deployments should be idempotent

The Role Of QA
Types of Testing:
●	Unit Testing
●	Code Hygiene
●	Integration Testing
●	TDD / BDD /ATDD
●	Infrastructure Testing
●	Performance Testing
●	Security Testing
